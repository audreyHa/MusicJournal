# MusiCord
With MusiCord, users can quickly organize recordings according to their own custom categories! When entering the app for the first time, users are presented with 8 different categories (song, composer, artist, instrument, album, etc.) to choose from, or they can create their own. After recording themselves playing a musical piece, users can select which of their 4 custom categories they will sort by, and the app will automatically reorder their recordings. Users can edit their category names and switch the method of organization at any time. They can also export their recordings to family and friends.

## Motivation
Musicians of all levels can greatly improve their musical skills by recording themselves playing a song and listening back to it. However, when musicians have many recordings and a busy schedule, organizing and finding recordings can be a difficult and time-consuming task. MusiCord is an app designed for all musicians, whether they’re students, teachers, or professionals, who wish to record themselves playing musical pieces and also organize them quickly and easily according to their preferred categories.
