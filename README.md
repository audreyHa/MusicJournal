# MusiCord
With MusiCord, users can quickly organize recordings according to their own custom categories! When entering the app for the first time, users are presented with 8 different categories (song, composer, artist, instrument, album, etc.) to choose from, or they can create their own. After recording themselves playing a musical piece, users can select which of their 4 custom categories they will sort by, and the app will automatically reorder their recordings. Users can edit their category names and switch the method of organization at any time. They can also export their recordings to family and friends.

## Motivation
Musicians of all levels can greatly improve their musical skills by recording themselves playing a song and listening back to it. However, when musicians have many recordings and a busy schedule, organizing and finding recordings can be a difficult and time-consuming task. MusiCord is an app designed for all musicians, whether they’re students, teachers, or professionals, who wish to record themselves playing musical pieces and also organize them quickly and easily according to their preferred categories.

## Privacy Policy
MusiCord incorporates a light-weight analytical tool called <b>Answers</b> (refer to [this document](https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf) for detailed privacy policy). This service is used to track how many times all users land on different screens. Data regarding your personal information (including name, gender, contact information, location) will not be collected. Your identity will not be linked to any of the observed behaviors.

The only purpose of collecting user behavior data for this version is to improve user experience and guide development for the next release. If you do not wish to participate and help the app (and me) better understand your needs, you are always welcome to come back and install a later version.

All data regarding your recordings and recording information is stored locally on your phone. No third party (including me!) has access to your personal data or content stored in this app.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at musicordmobileapp@gmail.com!

Happy MusiCording!

Sincerely,
Audrey Ha
