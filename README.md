# MusiCord
MusiCord is a recording app targeted towards musicians of all levels. Users record themselves playing a musical piece. After saving, they can play, edit, delete, and export their recordings. They can select whether they want the recordings to be sorted by song title, date, composer, or event. Users can switch the method of organization at any time, and the app automatically sorts their recordings by the chosen category.

## Motivation
Musicians of all levels can greatly improve their musical skills by recording themselves playing a song and listening back to it. However, when musicians have many recordings and a busy schedule, organizing and finding recordings can be a difficult and time-consuming task. MusiCord is an app designed for all musicians, whether they’re students, teachers, or professionals, who wish to record themselves playing musical pieces and also organize them quickly and easily.

## Features
Users enter the app, and press “Add New” to create a new recording. They fill in the song title, composer, and event and then record themselves playing the song. After hitting save, they can play, edit, delete, and send the recording. The users can select one out of the four following categories (song, date, composer, and event), and the app will automatically sort the recordings based on the category that they chose to help users save time. 

## Privacy Policy
MusiCord incorporates a light-weight analytical tool <b>Answers</b> (refer to this document [https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf] for detailed privacy policy). This service is used to track how many times all users land on different screens. Data regarding your personal information (including name, gender, email, location) will not be collected. Your identity will not be linked to any of the observed behaviors.

The only purpose of collecting user behvaior data for this version is to improve user experience and guide development for the next release. If you do not wish to participate and help the app (and me) better understand your needs, you are always welcome to come back and install a later version.

All data regarding your recordings and recording information is stored locally on your phone. No third party (including me!) has access to your personal data or content stored in this app.

Happy MusiCording!

Yours,
Audrey Ha
